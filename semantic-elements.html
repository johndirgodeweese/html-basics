    <h1>My Favorite Superheroes, a Semantic Web Page</h1>
    <h2>DC Heroes</h2>
    <p><em>DC superhero comics are the best.</em><br>
         Storylines are more complex and <u>often address real-life social issues</u>. <strong> favorite is Green Arrow.</strong></p>
    <h3><small>Marvel Heroes</small></h3>
    <p><q>Marvel superhero comics feel more two-dimensional.</q> However, Marvel is really killing it in the film and TV industry, whereas DC attempts to capitalize on the TV and film industries are more mediocre.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>But they do have decent movies and TV shows for whatever that's worth.</p>
    <blockquote>To summarize, Marvel heroes are not as cool as DC heroes.</blockquote>
